# Colour Catcher Game

A simple and fun browser-based game built with JavaScript where you must quickly click on the correct colour from a grid of coloured squares. The game challenges your speed and accuracy against a ticking timer.

## 📝 Problem Statement

A grid of coloured squares appears on the screen. A target colour is shown, and you must **click the correct colour** as quickly as possible. Each correct click earns you a point. You have limited time to score as high as you can!

## 🎯 Features

* **Grid of Random Colours:** Displayed dynamically on screen.
* **Target Colour:** Highlighted so you know which colour to find.
* **Scoring System:** Score increases on each correct click.
* **Countdown Timer:** Game runs for a set duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
* **Final Score Display:** Shows your total score at the end.
* **Dark/Light Theme Option:** Switch between themes as you prefer (optional feature).

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Start the game in your browser.
2. Look at the target colour displayed.
3. Click the matching colour square in the grid as fast as possible.
4. The timer counts down from 30 seconds.
